# Belly-Button-Biodiversity-Dashboard

## Objective
visualizing the bacterial data for each volunteer. Specifically,volunteers should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, volunteers will be able to identify which species of bacteria are present in their navel.
